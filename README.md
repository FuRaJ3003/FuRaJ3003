### 👋 Hi, I’m @pawel-krakowiak / Paweł Krakowiak
#### Determined self-taught man 😉


👀 My profile includes some public repositories with projects that you can take a look at. 
(Not all, but some - the more interesting ones.)

👨‍💻 I've been learning programming since 2016 including three years
of Python programming experience.

👍 Completed several commercial projects - websites and web applications.



Below are some of the technologies and programming languages that I use:
<ul>
 <li>2017 [🐍 Python / Django] [Native]</li>
 <li>2016 [🌐 HTML / CSS / PHP / SQL] </li>
 <li>2021 [🌸GraphQL]</li>

</ul>
